# Scholar Graph

**Scholar Graph** is a lightweight CLI tool that fetches co-author data from **DBLP** and visualizes it as an **interactive graph**.  
The tool allows you to explore academic collaboration networks directly from the terminal, with results displayed in an HTML graph that can be zoomed, dragged, and explored interactively.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Fetches co-author data from [DBLP](https://dblp.org/).
- Visualizes authors and co-authors as a **draggable, interactive graph**.
- Supports **depth control** for graph exploration.
- CLI-based usage with simple commands.
- Outputs graphs as HTML (open in browser for interactive visualization).
- Edge widths and node sizes scale based on number of joint publications.

```
### Example:

```bash 
python scholar_graph.py build "Zeshan Khan" --depth 2
```

This will:
Fetch Zeshan Khanâ€™s DBLP profile.
Parse co-authors and co-authors-of-co-authors (depth = 2).
Generate an interactive HTML graph.
Save it as scholar_graph.html in the current directory.

Open the file in a browser:
```bash
This will:

Fetch Zeshan Khanâ€™s DBLP profile.
Parse co-authors and co-authors-of-co-authors (depth = 2).
Generate an interactive HTML graph.
Save it as scholar_graph.html in the current directory.
Open the file in a browser:

```bash
open scholar_graph.html   # macOS
xdg-open scholar_graph.html  # Linux
start scholar_graph.html  # Windows
```
## Graph Features
Nodes â†’ Authors.
Edges â†’ Co-authorships.
Node size â†’ Number of collaborations.
Edge width â†’ Number of joint papers.
Hover tooltip â†’ Shows author name and publication count.
Interactive â†’ Drag, zoom, and explore relationships.

## CLI Options

The tool provides a simple command-line interface (CLI) to build and visualize co-author graphs from DBLP.

| Option          | Type    | Description                                                                 | Example                           |
|-----------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `build`         | Command | Builds the co-author graph for the given author name.                       | `python scholar_graph.py build "Zeshan Khan"` |
| `--depth`       | int     | Depth of co-author expansion (default: `1`). Higher values show more layers.| `--depth 2`                       |
| `--output`      | string  | Output HTML file name for visualization (default: `graph.html`).            | `--output zeshan_graph.html`      |
| `--max-authors` | int     | Maximum number of co-authors to expand per author (default: unlimited).     | `--max-authors 20`                |
| `--open`        | flag    | Automatically open the output HTML graph in the browser after generation.   | `--open`                          |

### Example Usage

```bash
# Build a co-author graph of depth 2 for Zeshan Khan
python scholar_graph.py build "Zeshan Khan" --depth 2 --output my_graph.html --open
